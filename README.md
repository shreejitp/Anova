# Anova
Analysis of variance for difference among categorical groups

Often we come across an important factor or variable that has a lot of interest. In a SaaS business for example, you could have AOV or churn as attributes the business cares about. Sometimes you want to look at the association of those important factors with a few variables.

You could end up looking for association between

a) Continuous and Continuous variable b) Continuous and Categorical variable c) Categorical and Categorical variable

There are a number of stastical tests availabe to understand the assocication among/between different variables.

ANOVA looks at association between a continuous variable and a categorical variable
